# frank-wolf-optimization
This repository provides a clean, class-based implementation of the Frank–Wolfe algorithm for low-rank matrix completion under a nuclear-norm constraint. It is structured to be easily extended (e.g. adding Pairwise Frank–Wolfe, alternative LMOs, or new objectives) and includes utilities for data loading, evaluation, and experiment scripts.
